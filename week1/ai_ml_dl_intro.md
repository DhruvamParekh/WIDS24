# AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning: Key Concepts

## Introduction

This week, we dive into the basics of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**. We'll explore what they are, how they relate to each other, and how they're applied, especially in the world of audio and music technology.

## What is AI, ML, and DL?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broad field that focuses on building machines capable of intelligent behavior. It includes various techniques, like expert systems, search algorithms, and evolutionary algorithms.

- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that teaches computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming.

- **Deep Learning (DL)** is a further subset of ML that uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to solve very complex problems. It’s the tech behind things like speech and image recognition.

### AI vs Machine Learning

- Traditional **AI** (like expert systems) is rule-based, meaning the programmer writes out all the logic for the machine.
- In **Machine Learning**, the system learns from data. It finds patterns and figures out rules on its own, rather than being explicitly told what to do.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data (data that’s already tagged with the correct answer).
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model tries to find patterns in data without any labels—just raw information.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The system learns by interacting with its environment and getting feedback (rewards or penalties) based on its actions.

## Popular Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forests**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- **Neural Networks** are especially important for **Deep Learning**, and they’re what we’ll focus on in later videos.

## What is Deep Learning?

- **Deep Learning** uses complex neural networks with many layers of neurons. These deep networks are good at learning from large amounts of data and solving very complicated problems, like recognizing objects in images or understanding spoken language.
- The key difference from traditional ML is that deep learning doesn’t require feature extraction; it learns from raw data (like audio, images, or text) and figures out the patterns itself.

## Traditional ML vs Deep Learning: Key Differences

- **Feature Engineering**: In traditional ML, you need to manually extract features from your data (for example, measuring frequency or pitch in audio). With deep learning, you just feed raw data to the system, and it automatically learns the important features.

- **Data and Resources**: Deep learning needs large datasets (hundreds of thousands or millions of examples) and significant computational power (e.g., GPUs). Traditional ML can work with smaller datasets and is less resource-intensive.

- **Applications**: Traditional ML is often enough for simpler tasks, like predicting prices or classifying emails. But for complex tasks, like recognizing objects in images or transcribing speech, deep learning shines.

## When to Use Deep Learning

- Use deep learning if:
  - You have **huge datasets**.
  - The problem is **complex** (like speech or image recognition).
  - You have access to **powerful hardware** (like GPUs).
  - Traditional ML techniques aren't cutting it.

## Deep Learning in Audio and Music

Here are some cool ways deep learning is used in audio and music:

- **Speech Recognition**: Understanding spoken words, detecting emotions in voice, or recognizing background noise.
- **Music Information Retrieval (MIR)**: Tasks like identifying music genres, recognizing instruments in a song, or even detecting the mood of a piece of music.
- **Music Generation**: Deep learning can be used to create new music from scratch, which is a super exciting area of research.

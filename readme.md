# Music Classification using Long Short-Term Memory

Welcome to the project! This initiative focuses on classifying music genres using machine learning, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We will explore various audio features and datasets, preprocess the data, and visualize the results using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Instructions to Submit Assignments

Weekly assignments will be pushed to this repository. You are required to fork this repo and submit your notebooks (assignment solutions) to the respective folders within this repo.

## Resources

### Week 1

#### Aim

During Week 1, we will review python and explore Numpy, Pandas, and Librosa for data manipulation and audio processing. We will also understand the basics of AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and by the end, we will be implementing an artificial neuron from scratch.

# Music Classification using Long Short-Term Memory 

Welcome to the project! This initiative focuses on classifying music genres using machine learning, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We will explore various audio features and datasets, preprocess the data, and visualize the results using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Instructions to Submit Assignments

Weekly assignments will be pushed to this repository. You are required to fork this repo and submit your notebooks (assignment solutions) to the respective folders within this repo.

### Week 4

#### Aim
In this week, we'll delve into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs, focusing on how they can be applied to predict music genres based on audio features.

#### Important Links
* [RNN Basics](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/deep-learning-tutorial/rnn)  
* [Understanding LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)  

These resources will cover much of the theory needed for LSTM, but we encourage you to look up implementations in libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

The final assignment will be released soon.

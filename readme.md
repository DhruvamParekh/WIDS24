# Music Classification using Long Short-Term Memory

Welcome to the project! This initiative focuses on classifying music genres using machine learning, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We will explore various audio features and datasets, preprocess the data, and visualize the results using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
